# Exercise 1 · MCP server

Your hand-written MCP server lives in this folder. Write it in any language you like. The full task is on the exercise page; this file is the short version plus your notes.

## What is already here

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lectures.json` | The course lectures. Your first tool reads this file. |
| `messages.jsonl` | The messages a client sends, in order, with what your server must answer. |
| `check.mjs` | The self-check. It starts your server, sends those messages and tells you what is wrong. |

## The two tools

1. **`find_lecture`**: everyone writes this one. Input: `number` (1 to 10). It returns the title and topics of that lecture from `lectures.json`. A number outside the range is not a crash and not a protocol error: it is a result with `isError: true` and a readable message.
2. **One of your own**: anything useful that reads local data. Give it a description a model can choose by. Every tool needs one: the self-check applies the same rule to all of them, because a description is the only thing a model reads when it decides what to call.

## Where this goes next

Do not throw this folder away after Exercise 1. From Exercise 3 it becomes **your project's own MCP server**: the same protocol loop, with the tools rewired from `lectures.json` to your real data. Its tools call exactly the same service functions your HTTP routes call, so a tool obeys the same rules an API request does, and it carries a user (the `MCP_TOKEN` in `.env.example`) so it may do what that person may do and no more.

That is the whole design, and it is one sentence: **one set of rules, two front doors.** An MCP tool that writes its own database query is a second way into your data with none of your rules on it, and Exercise 5 is very good at finding those.

Add an `mcp` script to `package.json` (`"mcp": "node mcp-server/server.js"`) so your agent, CI and the lecturer can all start the server the same way.

## Run the self-check

```bash
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- <your start command>
# for example
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- node mcp-server/server.js
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- python3 mcp-server/server.py
# once you have added the mcp script
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- npm run --silent mcp
```

It prints one line per check. Fix the failures yourself: the agent may explain a message or review your handler, but it must not write the protocol code for you.

## How to start it
<!-- The exact command, so the lecturer can run your server too. -->

```bash
npm run --silent mcp
```

```

## The description experiment
I made the custom tool description more specific by saying it should be used when the user asks which lecture covers a topic and the lecture number is not known. I have not run the connected Gemini CLI experiment, so I cannot yet report whether the model chose the tool differently. The description should help because it tells the model to use this tool for topic searches when the lecture number is unknown.

<!-- Run the connected Gemini CLI experiment and replace this note with its observed result before submission. -->
